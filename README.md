# dSciCapstoneSwiftKeyCoursera
Capstone project for the Johns Hopkins and Coursera Data Science Specialization

If you are not familiar with building n-gram models, I suggest viewing the Stanford series on this subject on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3kKlUBa3b0

Please don't use this code to pass the Capstone course without doing your own work.  You would only be cheating yourself of the experience.
